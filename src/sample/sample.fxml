        <!-- This works as follows: -->

        <!-- (that's the same 'imageView' variable that's at the top in the Controller.java class. That references this JavaFx component) -->
        <!-- After that i use an image tag -->
        <!-- Then I use an Image tag (not the difference in spelling. Capital 'I' and lowercase 'i') -->
        <!-- Then I have a button that says New Card, in the second row of the GridPane -->
        <!-- When it's clicked, it runs a method called 'newCard' that is in the Controller.java class -->
